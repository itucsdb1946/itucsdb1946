Accio is a community driven discussion and link agregation site.
It was inspired by `Reddit <https://www.reddit.com>`_.

In Accio, users can submit posts composed of links, texts, images and short videos.
Users can create tags that poeple will post to, and create communities with
their own rules and set of moderators.
